# MLW PROJECT – KWIK 2018/19
MLW project was created for the purpose of KWIK course (academic year 2018/2019) 
as a collection of various examples of psychological data analysis, with whom we have come across. 

Here you will find procedures for:  
- basic classical (frequentist) analysis:
  written in both R and Python (pandas) 
    https://www.r-project.org/about.html
    https://pandas.pydata.org/
- basic bayesian analysis:
  written in R (rstan)
    https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan
- basic eeg analysis:
  written in MATLAB (EEGlab, FieldTrip)
    https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB
    http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/documentation/
- basic machine learning analysis:
  written in Python (TensorFlow, sci-kit learn)
    https://www.tensorflow.org/
    https://scikit-learn.org/0.20/_downloads/scikit-learn-docs.pdf  

All procedures are annotated and ready-to-use with:
- Jupyter Notebook
https://jupyter.org/documentation
- Google Colaboratory 
https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb
(exceptions are only those written in MATLAB concerning EEG analysis) and the access to the attached databases.

Nevertheless, we encourage you to modify the source code and adjust it to your own data and ideas. 

Hope you will find it useful in the best case, not too vague at the very least.
